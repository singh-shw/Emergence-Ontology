Abstract - Emergence has been studied in various fields, including engineering, computer science, economics, etc. However, there is no agreed-upon definition of what emergence means.  There is no common framework that would support researchers in representing their emergence theories and comparing them with others. As a result, emergence remains a debatable topic among researchers who want to understand and use emergence to engineer their systems. This paper introduces a framework that enables researchers to encode key aspects of emergence theories into an ontology using the Emergence Metaontology. This metaontology provides the basic vocabulary specialized to the domain of emergence which can be used to describe the major features of specific emergence theories. Researchers will be able to add their theories to those that are already encoded, and then use queries to examine and compare these theories. OWL reasoners can infer new facts and possibly identify inconsistencies. This will allow researchers to gain a greater understanding of these existing theories. In case inconsistencies are detected due to conflicting theories, we propose a user-guided process to deal with them.  The paper presents a systematic approach adopted to identify basic concepts for inclusion in the metaontology and a systematic approach to its evaluation based on competency questions. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt in the emergence domain to use a query-supported ontological approach to encode and compare multiple theories of emergence.
